## Hello All,

My name is Mukund Tiwari and I am working as a Data Science Intern at CodSoft. 

The Task that I have performed is :- 

**Task-3 : IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION**

*Problem Statement :-*

The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their measurements.

Now, imagine that you have the measurements of Iris flowers categorized by their respective species. 

Your objective is to train a machine learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species.
